## Muon Resistive Plate Chamber Project

The electronics parts of new Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) singlet are carefully examined by Gas Gap Quality Test, Noise Level Test, Manchester Decoder Test, Efficiency Curve Test and Signal Quality Test. It is shown that the new prototype still have unsolved problems of Discriminator Module (DIS), Time-to-Digital Converter Module (TDC), Acceptance, Quality of readout strips. Further Study is required to uncover the whole picture of issue in the current upgrade of RPC to
ensure the stability and efficiency.
