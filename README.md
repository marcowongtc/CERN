## Muon Resistive Plate Chamber Project

The electronics parts of new Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) singlet are carefully examined by Gas Gap Quality Test, Noise Level Test, Manchester Decoder Test, Efficiency Curve Test and Signal Quality Test. It is shown that the new prototype still have unsolved problems of Discriminator Module (DIS), Time-to-Digital Converter Module (TDC), Acceptance, Quality of readout strips. Further Study is required to uncover the whole picture of issue in the current upgrade of RPC to
ensure the stability and efficiency.

## CaloMuonScore Project
>Identify real muon by collecting data from calorimeter with machine learning algorithm with working point tuning  

CaloMuonScore is an algorithm that aims at recovering efficiency in the ATLAS muon detector system, which is an inner detector system and muon spectrometer
system. CaloMuonScore identifies muon from background by processing the energy deposits pattern of the particle in calorimeter using convolutional neural network. CaloMuonScore is proven to be outperforming the old
identification algorithm, a energy threshold based CaloMuonIDTag. However, the performance of CaloMuonScore need to be investigate closer before using it in analysis.
