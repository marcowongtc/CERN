## RPC Muon Spectrometer Efficiency 
Here we measure the efficiency of the RPC Muon Spectrometer by Counting the number of muon detected by the scintillator and the newly upgraded RPC.   
The number of muon is obtained by counting the detector signals with exceeding a threshold voltage $V_{th}$

> #### Efficiency ε
>$ε = N_{detector} / N_{ScintCoinc}$
> #### Error Bar δ
>$δ = \sqrt{ε(1-ε)/N_{ScintCoinc}}$


Efficiency is plotted against the High Voltage applied HV with three working points `3WP`
>- to uncover possible defects in RPC
>- to learn the RPC science | avalanche, electronics, detector physics  


## Efficiency Counting Update | Analyzing the Quality of Peaks

Quality of Peaks is analyzed with several notable characteristic 
> - Peak Maximum
> - Time Width
> - Leading Time + Trailing Time 
> - Peak Number
